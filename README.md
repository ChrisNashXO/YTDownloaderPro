# YTDownloaderPro
This is based on yt-dlp Project, C# version of it for people who wants to use GUI instead

Imrovements over DLP Project:
1. It provides direct GUI to enter your video URL.
2. It asks for folder to save in GUI.
3. No need to set environment variable for base dlp.exe to work, it does it through installation automatically for you.
4. Works best for non tech savvy people.

Below Code is using yt-dlp as base code to download videos, It uses additional dependencies to download videos in Best Available quality.
